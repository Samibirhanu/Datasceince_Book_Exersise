# Initialize the dict with an empty list for each user id:
friendships = {user["id"]: [] for user in users}

# And loop over the friendship pairs to populate it:
for i, j in friendship_pairs:
    friendships[i].append(j) # Add j as a friend of user i
    friendships[j].append(i) # Add i as a friend of user j
